			A few words about my person. I graduated from the John Paul II Technical
			and Vocational School Complex in Å»uromin, majoring in IT Technician. In
			addition to computer science, I am also interested in many different
			fields. I love visiting museums, art and especially the work of Zdzislaw
			Beksinski. For several years I have also been interested in fashion, this
			passion started walking around second-hand stores. This hobby helps to
			take care of our planet, by putting old clothes back into circulation
			which can significantly reduce the need for the production of new ones,
			which would consume more liters of water, kW of energy.
